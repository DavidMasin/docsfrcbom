## **Introduction**

The **Team Dashboard** is the central hub where your team can manage the Bill of Materials (BOM) for your robot's manufacturing process. This document explains the layout, functionality, and features available in the Team Dashboard.

---

## **Accessing the Dashboard**

- After logging in, your team will be redirected to your **Team Dashboard URL**:  
  `frcbom.com/{team_number}`

| **Description**           | A description of the part.      |
| **Material BOM**          | The material used for the part. |
| **Quantity Required**     | The number of parts needed.     |
| **Pre-Process**           | Preparation steps, if required. |
| **Pre-Process Quantity**  | Current quantity completed.     |
| **Process 1**             | The main production process.    |

### **Table Interactions**

1. **Click on a Part:**
    - Opens the **Part Details View**, where you can:
        - Edit quantities.
        - Update processes.

2. **Adjust Quantities:**
    - Use the `+` and `-` buttons to adjust quantities in real time.

3. **Automatic Saving:**
    - All changes are automatically saved and synced with the server.

---


## **Best Practices**

1. **Regularly Update Quantities:**
    - Ensure part quantities are updated after each manufacturing step.

2. **Check Filter Views:**
    - Use filters to ensure no part is left behind.

3. **Verify Onshape Integration:**
    - Ensure processes are properly set in Onshape using the custom FeatureScript.

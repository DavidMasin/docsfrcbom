# **FRC BOM System - FeatureScript Setup Guide**

---

## **Introduction**

To ensure seamless integration between your Onshape CAD models and the FRC BOM System, you need to use the **Custom FeatureScript (FS)**. This FeatureScript allows you to assign specific manufacturing processes to each part in your robotâ€™s assembly. When the BOM data is fetched, the system will recognize these processes and update the manufacturing pipeline accordingly.

---

## **Why Use the FeatureScript?**

The FRC BOM FeatureScript enables you to:

- Assign **Pre-Process**, **Process 1**, and **Process 2** to each part in your assembly.
- Ensure that every part follows the correct production path.
- Eliminate manual entry errors when importing BOM data into the FRC BOM System.

## **Step 1: Adding the FeatureScript to Your Onshape Document**

1. **Open Onshape:**
    - Visit [Onshape](https://www.onshape.com) and open your CAD document.

2. **Navigate to "Custom Features":**
    - In your Onshape toolbar, click the **"+" (Insert Feature)** button.
    - Select **"Import Custom Feature"**.

3. **Add the FeatureScript:**
    - Use the following public link to access the FeatureScript:

## **Step 2: Using the FeatureScript in an Assembly**

1. **Open Your Part Studio:**
    - In Onshape, go to the part studio where you want to assign processes.

2. **Add the FeatureScript:**
    - Click the **"Custom Features"** button from the toolbar.
    - Select **"FRC BOM Process Assignment"** from the list.

3. **Assign Processes:**
    - **Select Parts:** Choose the part(s) you want to assign a process to.
    - **Process Fields:**
        - **Pre-Process:** (Optional) Set initial preparation steps (e.g., cutting material).
        - **Process 1:** Main process (e.g., CNC, 3D Printing, Lathe).
        - **Process 2:** Additional process (e.g., assembly or final finishing).

4. **Click "OK"**
    - The processes will be applied and saved automatically.

## **Troubleshooting Tips**

| **Issue**                               | **Solution**                        |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Processes Not Showing in BOM Table**  | Ensure the FeatureScript was applied correctly in Onshape. |
| **Parts Missing from BOM**              | Verify that parts are visible in the Onshape assembly.     |
| **BOM Fetch Fails**                     | Check API credentials and document permissions.            |

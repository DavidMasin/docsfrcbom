The purpose of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive reference for our robotâ€™s Bill of Materials. Maintaining a transparent and detailed BOM is crucial for:

- **Competition Compliance:** Ensure all components and costs meet FIRST Robotics Competition guidelines.
- **Repeatability & Maintenance:** Having a reference allows future iterations to quickly identify and order parts.
- **Knowledge Transfer:** New team members can quickly get up to speed on what parts are used and why.

This guide covers:
- How the BOM is structured.
- Methods and best practices for updating and maintaining the BOM.
- Links to vendor datasheets and component info.
